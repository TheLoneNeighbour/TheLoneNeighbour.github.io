  <h1>What are Furries?</h1>
  <p>Furries are a subculture interested in anthropomorphic animals - that is, animals with human-like characteristics. This can include anything from artistic expressions and costumes to role-playing and social events.</p>
  <p>Many furries enjoy creating and wearing costumes called "fursuits" which are often elaborate and can be quite expensive to create. Some furries also enjoy creating and sharing artwork featuring anthropomorphic animals.</p>
  <p>While the concept of furries may seem strange or unusual to some, it is important to remember that it is a legitimate form of self-expression and art for many people. It is important to respect the individuality and creativity of those who are part of the furry community.</p>
  <p class="warning">Note: It is not appropriate to invade the privacy or personal space of any individual, regardless of their involvement in the furry community or any other subculture. It is always important to obtain consent before taking photographs or touching someone else's costume.</p>
